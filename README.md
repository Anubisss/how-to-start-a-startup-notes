# How to Start a Startup - Notes

This is my personal notes/quotes about the How to Start a Startup YouTube video series. I just simply write down the most important things (for me at least) about each part of the series.

YouTube channel: [How to Start a Startup](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxIJaCMEptJjxmmQgGFsnCg)

### Lecture 1 - How to Start a Startup
Info:
 * YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBYhVcO4WgI
 * Speakers:
  * Sam Altman (President of Y Combinator)
  * Dustin Moskovitz (Cofounder of Facebook, Asana and Good Ventures)

Notes:
* Good idea.
  * Need a problem and need an idea: you (as a founder) have a problem and you want to solve it with your product.
  * **The idea should come first (side project) and the startup should come second (company).**
  * The best ideas often look terrible at the beginning.
  * Good startup ideas are almost always very easy to explain and very easy to understand. If it takes more than a sentence to explain what you're doing then it's almost always a sign that it's too complicated. It should be a clearly articulated vision with a small number of words.
  * You want an idea that turns into a monopoly, but you can't get a monopoly in a big market right away. Too much competition for that. You have to find a small specific market in which you can get a monopoly and then quickly expand.
  * It's not usually dangerous to tell people about your idea. The truly good ideas don't sound like they're worth stealing.
  * If you're lucky and you have a bad startup idea you fail quickly, but most of the time it's not like that.
* Importance of the product.
  * Great idea -> Great product -> Great company.
  * Start with something simple. It's much much easier to make a great product if you have something simple. Another reason is because it forces you to do one thing extremely well.
  * As a founder make sure that the company builds a great product. Until you've built a great product almost nothing else matters.
  * Raising money, getting more press, hiring, business development, etc. These are significantly easier when you have a great product. It's really important to take care of that first.
  * **Just build a product and get it as good as possible by talking to your users. Build something that users love.**
  * You should meet potential co-founders.
* Market.
  * The growth of the market is matters too not only growth of the startup itself.
  * Startup with a small but rapidly growing market is usually better then a startup with a big but slow growing one.
  * **In general it's best if you building something that you yourself need. You'll understand it much better then if you have to understand it by talking to a customer to build the very first version of your product. So you will be the customer.**
  * If you're building something that someone else needs, realize that you're at a big disadvantage and get very, very close to your customers.
  * It's better to build something that a small number of users love than a large number of users like. It's much easier to expand from something that a small number of people love to something that a lot of people love than from something that a lot of people like to a lot of people love. So find a small group of users and make them really love what you're doing.
* Customer feedback.
  * It's important to thinking about what customers want and thinking about the demands of the market.
  * **Get users to give you feedback. You don't need many at the early days. Recruit them by hand.**
  * Ask your users what they like and what they don't like and watch them use it. Ask them what they pay for. Ask them if they'd be really bummed if your product went away. Ask them what would make them recommend the product to their friends and ask them if they' have recommended it to any yet.
  * Customer support is very important.
* Growth.
  * **Growth is the indicator of a great product.**
  * A great product is the secret to long term growth hacking. You should get that right before you worry about anything else.
  * If you try to build a growth machine before you have a product that some people really love, you're almost certainly gonna waste your time.
  * Breakout companies almost always have a product that's so good that it grows by word of mouth.
  * Over the long run great product win.
  * Measure and use metrics.
  * When people really love something they tell their friends about it and you'll see organic growth.
  * Don't try and hire sales and customer support people at the early days. You gotta do this yourself. It's the only way.
  * If you don't have some early organic growth then your product probably isn't good enough yet.
* Why start a startup?
  * You can't not do it. -> You need to do it.
  * **You're super passionate about this idea.**
  * You're the right person to do it. You've gotta make it happen.
  * The world needs you to do it. Because the world needs it. Otherwise do something that the world needs.
  * You couldn't stop working on it.
